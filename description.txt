-------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: Updated to include an initial version of custom hero creation! The vast majority of heroes can now be created. For the time being some of the UI still refers to lord creation, and it uses the same trait list as lord creation. Please let me know any issues you find.
-------------------------------------------

This mod adds a brand new custom UI which allows you to customize lords before recruitment. The custom UI allows you to modify the lords name, type, skills, traits and starting attributes. To create a custom lord, click the �Custom� button in the lord recruitment screen.

The mod should work for any faction, and should be compatible with almost any other mod.

This first version of the mod does not include many custom skill sets, however these will be added shortly and the UI can still be used to customize traits and attributes for almost unlimited possibilities.

The mod also features a custom table loader, which allows other mods to easily integrate with this mod. If you would like more information on this, please contact me.

Many thanks to the guys at C&C Modding Den Discord for helping with this, and to Cataph for creating the workshop image!

As this mod is very complex, please let me know if you find any issues so that I can fix them! I have created a bug reports discussion specifically for this.

FAQ
Q. Is this mod savegame compatible?
A. The mod can be enabled for any existing savegame and should not cause any issues.

Q. I can't see the button to recruit custom lords.
A. This is most likely due to missing the dependant mods, UI Modding Framework. This may also be due to another mod causing the scripts to crash, which in turn affects this one.

Q. Is this mod compatible with ***?
A. The mod is designed to be as compatible as possible. The mod is mainly script driven which means very few conflicts should occur. Where compatibility issues do occur, the custom table loader should allow the issues to be resolved fairly easily by the author of the other mod.

Q. Does the AI use custom lords?
A. The AI will recruit lords with custom skill sets. Integration with custom traits and attributes will be added at a later date.

Q. Can I still recruit standard lord?
A. Yes! This mods adds a new option when recruiting, but all existing recruitment options still work as usual.

Q. Will this mod work in multiplayer?
A. Unfortunately not. I will look at updating this in the future.
